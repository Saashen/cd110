      I see my career path in creating. Beautiful, convenient, exciting, and
      valuable simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have advanced technologies and tools to make sophisticated
      communication channels. Despite this, they are not implemented in most of
      our lives. Here is why I cannot imagine creating without organizing and
      promoting. These are my study goals which can be achieved via a set of
      methods: education, work, entrepreneurship, and volunteering.
    </p>
    <p>
      My career goal is to reduce the time everyone spends on meaningless
      processes. The process of filing papers does not contain a value. The
      process of learning does. Though we need to collect data, I would like to
      create ways of painless collection. Life is too short to submit and
      process information manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have clear intentions, but I leave some space for unpredictability.
      Whatever I plan now, I am not aware of all the possibilities and ways to
      reach my target.
